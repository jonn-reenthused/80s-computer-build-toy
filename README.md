# 80s-computer-build-toy
This is a very simple build toy in the style of an 80s computer, lightly inspired by the IBM 5150

### Upcoming
I'll be making a monitor in the style of the 5151 and a keyboard, i'll add them here when i'm done.

### Extending
If you want to make your own drives or cards i've included blank versions of both that you can edit
